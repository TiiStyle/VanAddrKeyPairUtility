# VanAddrKeyPairUtility
GUI-Utility to work with keyconv

A keyconv-executable is already placed in the debug-folder that you simply can test the GUI without having to search for a keyconv-File or having to search for the correct place that the program runs.

You also can only download a standalone-executable when you go to
\VanAddrKeyPairUtility\VanAddrKeyPairUtility\bin\Debug

You find the keyconv file in the same directory.
