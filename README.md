# VanAddrKeyPairUtility
GUI-Utility to work with keyconv

A keyconv-executable is already placed in the debug-folder that you simply can test the GUI without having to search for a keyconv-File or having to search for the correct place that the program runs.

You also can only download a standalone-executable when you go to
\VanAddrKeyPairUtility\VanAddrKeyPairUtility\bin\Debug

You find the keyconv file in the same directory.

The keyconv file needs to be placed in the same directory as the executable of VanAddrKeyPairUtility.

Feel free to replace the keyconv file with a newer version but I can't guarantee that it still works with the new version without making significant code changes! (Due to this being a very small program even significant changes are not that much)
